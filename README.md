Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Professional â€“ Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning progress in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Professional Course. 
The course is designed for Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and AI Engineers to effectively leverage OCIâ€™s suite of tools for building, training, deploying, and managing machine learning solutions at scale.

ðŸ“Œ Course Overview

The course covers the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle and MLOps practices on OCI, including:
Configuring and managing Data Science workspaces and projects.
Using the Accelerated Data Science (ADS) SDK for streamlined ML workflows.
Preparing data, training models, evaluating performance, and deploying models.
Applying MLOps practices for automation, monitoring, and scaling.
Integrating with other OCI services such as Vault, Object Storage, Data Flow, Data Labeling, and Generative AI.
